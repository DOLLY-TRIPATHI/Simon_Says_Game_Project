## 🎮 Simon Says Game – Project Description

### 🔹 Overview:

The **Simon Says Game** is a browser-based interactive memory game where the player mimics a sequence of color patterns generated by the computer. With each successful round, the sequence grows longer, challenging the player's memory. This project is designed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, showcasing fundamental web development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation.

* 🔊 Sound effects for each color
* ⚡ Visual animations to indicate button presses
* ⏫ Increasing difficulty as pattern length grows
* ❌ Game over detection with restart functionality

* **HTML5** – Game layout and structure
* **CSS3** – Styling, animations, and responsive design
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** – Game logic, sequence generation, event handling, and audio integration

### 🔹 How It Works:

1. The game begins when the user presses any key.
2. The system generates a random color and flashes it.
3. The user must click the same color.
4. The system then adds another random color to the sequence.
5. The user must repeat the entire sequence correctly.
6. If the user makes a mistake, a “Game Over” screen is displayed and the game resets.
